# Clip Timestamp Collector

Clip Timestamp Collector is a lightweight web app that helps streamers save time by allowing viewers to mark clip-worthy moments during live streams.

Instead of rewatching entire VODs, streamers get a structured list of timestamps with context, submitted live by their community.

## Core Idea
Viewers click a single button when something interesting happens.
The app records the timestamp relative to the stream start.
After the stream, the streamer reviews and clips faster.

## MVP Scope
- Stream session creation
- Viewer timestamp submission with optional notes
- Streamer review dashboard
- Exportable timestamp list

## Explicitly Out of Scope (v1)
- Twitch / YouTube APIs
- Authentication
- Bots or chat commands
- Automated clipping
- AI analysis

## Status
Early MVP – actively being built and validated with a live streaming community.
